        Hi, my name is Madeline Klein. 
        I am a user experience writer at a healthcare company. Before this role, I got my bachelor’s degree in journalism at Mizzou. I am pursuing my MBA now to expand my knowledge and skills in the business space.
    <br>
    Through my career I've worked with companies to help improve their users’ experience. I do so by refining and optimizing their content. In my free time I enjoy taking my two dogs, Maple and Walter, for walks. I enjoy reading books from every genre. Moving forward my goal is to continue growing in the UX field. I hope to help with the development of good experiences for users.
