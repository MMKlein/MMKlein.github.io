            <h3>Learn the basics about UX Writing</h3>
            <h4>What is UX Writing?</h4>
            <p>User experience writing or UX writing is about making websites and applications easy to navigate. It’s the copy on buttons, menus, error messages, webpages, checkout screens, and more that guide users through an experience. UX writing is an intentional form of writing that highlights task completion and easy website use. The main goal is to ensure content is clear and simple, so users don’t get confused and leave your website. Think about UX writing like a friendly guide, meeting you where you’re at with your language to help you complete the intended task.</p>
            <h4>Why should I care?</h4>
            <p>In our modern world, the digital user experience is important to businesses’ success. This section highlights why you should care about UX writing. It empowers users to move through your website, guiding them to complete intended tasks. Crafting clear and concise copy enhances the user experience. This results in higher conversion rates and in turn better customer satisfaction. Well-written UX copy leaves a lasting positive impression, building a positive perception of your brand and fostering trust. Investing in UX writing not only benefits your users and their interactions, but it amplifies your company’s reputation – leading to future loyalty and success.</p>
            <h4>UX writing vs other writing careers.</h4>
            <p>UX writing is unique from other writing and content careers due to its focus on optimizing user experiences. Content strategists often collaborate with business stakeholders during the planning stage, and copywriters often work on marketing teams writing content for advertisements, blogs, social media, and more. UX writers aren’t often involved in the organization’s strategy like content strategists and are less focused on gaining customers like copywriters. However, across all writing positions, it’s important to maintain the brand voice and tone.</p>

            <h3>How to implement UX Writing on your team</h3>
            <h4>How does UX Writing fit in the website development process?</h4>
            <p>The specific dynamic between a UX writer and development team will differ based on company size and structure. However, in my experience, I’ve been involved in the beginning stages of the development process. I’ll share an example to communicate the process. Business and data stakeholders decide the company’s homepage isn’t driving enough conversions. UX designers, writers, and researchers build usability studies to determine what users see and feel when they’re on the webpage. Then, UX design begins to build the wireframe, collaborating with writers to brainstorm copy. Once we’re sure it aligns with research findings, design will begin on the prototype – which will also be tested and continuously optimized. Once the team has a prototype we’re confident in, we will present it to stakeholders and share it with developers to work into upcoming sprints. After the sprint, design and writers will review webpages to ensure consistency with the prototype. Eventually, the website goes live and drives more conversions.</p>
            <h4>UX writers and UX designers.</h4>
            <p>An exciting element of UX writing is working closely with UX designers. Designers focus on the visual elements on the webpage, collaborating with writers on the specific copy for buttons, headings, and more. The strongest teams have individuals in these positions who can work well together. In my experience, the closer you cooperate, the stronger the product or webpage will be because you’re able to continually iterate and bring different viewpoints and insights to the product. The open communication allows for strong brainstorming sessions too.</p>
            <h4>Team members you’ll work with.</h4>
            <p>As a UX writer, you’ll work with a variety of team members. Let’s list a few – product manager, web developer or software developer, UX designers, UX researcher, marketing manager, product owner, project manager, data analyst or data scientist, program manager, QA tester, and more depending on the specific organization. Because of the variety of positions you work with, it’s important to have good communication and presentation skills, know how to collaborate with individuals who think differently than you, and have time management and prioritization skills.</p>

            <h3>Pillars of UX content</h3>
            <h4>Understand users.</h4>
            <p>The main pillar of UX content is to understand the users. This is crucial because it drives the creation of products that cater to the audience’s needs. Learning about their preferences, behaviors, and pain points allows UX writers to tailor messaging and content to resonate with users. This understanding also prevents the inclusion of personal biases, ensuring the product meets user expectations rather than reflecting the writer’s own beliefs. It also challenges internal teams to think outside the box and brainstorm innovative solutions that truly address user concerns. When UX writers prioritize user understanding, they lay the foundation for user-focused experiences that drive engagement, satisfaction, and product success.</p>
            <h4>Keep content short and simple.</h4>
            <p>Another pillar of UX content is to keep content short and simple. By keeping language simple and messaging concise, users can quickly and easily understand the information on the website. This helps avoid confusion and prevents users from feeling frustrated or overwhelmed – leading to page abandonment. When UX writers craft copy that’s easy to comprehend and follow, users are more likely to have a positive experience, feel empowered, and develop trust in the brand or company.</p>
            <h4>Consistency, structure, and organization.</h4>
            <p>Consistency, structure, and organization make up the third pillar of UX content. Consistency ensures users’ experience is seamless across various touchpoints. This builds familiarity, reduces cognitive load, establishes trust and reliability, and allows users to navigate easily through the content. Structure is important because it provides a logical framework. It consists of organizing information in a manner that allows users to scan so they can find what they need quickly. Organization involves categorizing and labeling content in a way that aligns with users’ mental models, allowing them to find and understand information with ease. The combination of these three elements fosters a positive user experience.</p>
